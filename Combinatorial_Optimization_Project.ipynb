    "### 2. Huffman Codes\n",
    "\n",
    "#### The data compression problem\n",
    "At the heart of every computer lies the representation of symbols using binary digits (bits). In computers,  letters of the alphabet are not stored as such, but are being represented by a combination of zeros and ones. \n",
    "\n",
    "On the one hand, this encoding requieres a unified standard of encoding, so that machines can communicate with each other. That is why unified transformation formats such as ASCII or UTF are of great importance. In these systems, symbols are being represented through a fixed number of bits. ASCII for example uses 7 bits for encoding, which allows the representation of $2^7 = 128$ different symbols. This encoding ensures that files can be exchanged between different machines without loss of information. However, it seems like encoding every symbol with 7 bits is quite wasteful from a storage persepective (Kleinberg & Tardos 2008). Encoding the string \"hello world\" using 7 bits for each symbol (including spaces) results in a total number of 77 bits. This seems rather large, given that the original string has only 11 symbols. It would be better if one could encode every symbol with the smallest number of bits possible. A solution for this problem is the use of variable length encoding (Kleinberg & Tardos, 2008). At the basis of variable length encoding is the idea, that symbols which occur often in a given document, are encoded with a smaller amount of bits than others. \n",
    "\n",
    "The question is however, how to ensure the uniqueness of each encoding. Lets say we've encoded \"a\" as a \"1\", b as \"0\" and c as \"01\". A string \"abc\" would then theoretically look like this: \"1001\". However, an algorithm which tries to decode this string would traverse over the zeros and ones and then return a letter once it finds a match. In this case, in the first step the algorithm would find the \"1\" and return \"a\". In the second step it would find the \"0\" and return a \"b\"; so far so good. However, in the third step, the algorithm would again stop at the \"0\" and return another \"b\". The decoded string would then be \"abba\" and not \"abc\". \n",
    "\n",
    "A way to deal with this is the use of so called prefix code. We have to make sure, that every code is not the prefix of another code. It is no problem however, if a string is a substring of another string, as long as it's not a prefix.(Kleinberg & Tardos, 2008).\n",
    "\n",
    "So the problem at hand is now twofold: How do we get a code that can be used to en- and decode a given set of symbols unabmigously and how do we ensure that the encoding is of minimal length?\n",
    "\n",
    "The definition of encoding legnth is as following (Tardos & Kleinberg, 2008).\n",
    "Given text $T$, each symbol $s \\in T$  occurs with a  given frequency $f_s$. The encoding of $s$ is $c(s)$ where $c(s)$ represents a binary string. The average bit length required to encode a given text is then:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\sum_{s \\in T}^{} f_s \\mid c(s) \\mid $$ \n",
    "\n",
    "where $\\mid c(s) \\mid $ denotes the length of the encoding $c(s)$ in number of bits.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2.1.1 The Huffman Code \n",
    "\n",
    "Huffman (1952) propses a greedy algorithm as a solution to this problem. The idea behind Huffmans encoding can be easily represented using a binary tree (Kleinberg & Tardos, 2008). In a binary tree, each node that is not a leaf has two children. We can imagine a tree, for which leaf is associated with one symbol from a given alphabet that we want to encode. From such a binary tree, a prefix code arises naturally (Kleinberg & Tardos, 2008). For a given letter, one can follow the path from the root to the leaf and write down a 0 for every left path one takes and a 1 for every right path. The resulting string is then a prefix code for the given letter (Kleinberg & Tardos, 2008). This also ensures, that no encoding is a prefix of another encoding, since all symbols are in the leafs of the tree. Consequently, finding a binary tree for a given alphabet is equivalent to finding a prefix code for the alphabet.\n",
    "\n",
    "Further, the tree structure also translates to the length of the encoding. The length of the path from the root to a given letter $x$ is equivalent to the length of the encoding in bits. This can be represented as the depth of the tree. Huffman (1952) presents an algorithm to find the optimal prefix code.\n",
    "\n",
    "Given an alphabet $A$, take the two lowest frequency symbols $x^*$ and $y^*$ and construct a \"meta-symbol\" out of them whose frequency is the sum of the frequencies of $x^*$ and $y^*$. This \"meta-symbol\" will later then be added to the alphabet, which has now been reduced by one symbol. Recursively repeat this combining of symbols until the alphabet has been reduced to two symbols. Once this state has been reached, label one symbol with 1 and the other with 0. Now \"unpack\" the \"meta-symbols\" and label them accordingly. \n",
    "\n",
    "The resulting binary tree yields an optimal prefix code. What is the greedy part of this algorithm? At every step, the algorithm only considers the two lowest frequency symbols of the current alphabet. At the moment of the merging, it is not clear, where in the tree these two symbols will end up. However, this algorithm still results in an optimal binary tree and prefix code, as we will discuss now.\n",

    "#### 2.1.2 Proof of Correctness\n",
    "\n",
    "Our proof of correctness follows the exposition by Kleinberg and Tardos (2008).\n",
    "The algorithm is invoked recursively on smaller and smaller alphabets, until it reaches an alphabet with two symbols. The case of two symbols is trivial, since an optimal encoding will just be representing one symbol with 1 and the other with 0. Now suppose by induction, that the algorithm works on alphabets with size $k-1$. We'll now have to prove, that it in fact also works for alphabets of size $k$ (Kleinberg & Tardos, 2008). At every step the algorithm merges the two lowest-frequency symbols $y^*, z^* \\in A$ into a meta-symbol $\\omega$ and is invoked recurisvely on the smaller alphabet $A'$. By induction it then provides an optimal prefix code for $A'$ represented by a binary tree $T'$. It then augments $T'$ to $T$ by unpacking $\\omega$ and adding the symbols $y^*$ and $z^*$ as new children to $\\omega$. We now have to check how the depth of the trees changes from $T'$ to $T$. How did the average bit length change from $T'$ to $T$? In $T'$ the depth of each letter besides the \"packed\" $y^*$ and $z^*$ is the same as in $T$. Further, the depth of these two symbols is one step larger than the depth of $\\omega$ in $T'$. Given this, and using that $f_{\\omega}= f_{z^*} + f_{y^*}$ we can see, that the average bit length of $T$, $ABL(T)$ is equal to the average bit length of $T'$ plus the frequency of $\\omega$. (Kleinberg & Tardos, 2008).\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ ABL(T) = f_{\\omega} + ABL(T') $$\n",
    "\n",
    "We can now prove that the Huffman Code for a given algorithm results in a minimum average number of bits per letter by proof by contracdition. Assume that there is a tree tree $T$ resulting from Huffmans algorithm that is not optimal. Let $Z$ be an optimal tree that with leaves of $y^*$ and $z^*$ which are siblings. Deleting the leaves $y^*$ and $z^*$ from $Z$ and merging them into a meta symbol $\\omega$ we get a tree $Z'$ that defines a prefix code for a smaller alphabet. We can then show, that $ABL(Z) = ABL(Z') + f_{\\omega}$. In this case, $ABL(T') = ABL( T ) - f_{\\omega}> ABL( Z ) - f_{\\omega} = ABL(Z')$ which would mean that $T'$ is suboptimal as well. This is a contractidtion, since by induction, $T'$ is optimal.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2.1.3 Complexity\n",
    "\n",
    "In our implementation, the complexity is $O(k^2)$ where $k$ is the number of symbols in the alphabet. At every step of the recursion, the algorithm is called on a smaller alphabet, at at every step the two symbols with the lowest frequencies have to be identified. Finding the symbols with the lowest frequency takes at most time $O(k)$, if one has to traverse the whole alphabet. In total, there are $k-1$ recursions, so in total the time is $O(k^2)$ (Kleinberg & Tardos, 2008). \n",
    "\n",
    "However, in our implementation it is important to note, that the frequencies of the alphabet also have to be computed. This can also be done in linear time, since every symbol in the text has to be counted once. One could imagine a case, where the original text only consists of a couple of letters, in the case of DNA for example, but is very long. Given a DNA string consisting of three letters, but with length 1000, the counting would take longer than the building of the binary tree which has only three leaves. "

    "#### 2.2 Algorithm for decoding a text T, given a prefix.\n",
    "\n",
    "Having shown how to reach an optimal prefix encoding, the question is now how to decode an encoded text, given a prefix code. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2.2.1 Decoding Algorithm\n",
    "\n",
    "The proposed algorithm traverses the given input string, which only consists of 0 and 1. At the begining, it reads in the first bit and compares it to the given dictionary. If the first bit is encoding a symbol, as defined in the dictionary, then the symbol will be appended to an output string. The pointer then moves one step further.\n",
    "If the first bit doesn't encode a symbol, then the next bit will be added to the first bit, resulting in a larger bit string. Then, the comparision with the dictionary is repeated. This process continues until a bit string has been built that actually encodes a symbol. \n",
    "\n",
    "Having found a bit string and having appended the resulting symbol to the output string, the algorithm continues at the next bit of the string which hasn't been encountered yet. The algorithm finishes once it has reached the end of the encoded string. The algorithm is in a sense greedy, since it only checks the first bit it encounters. If it doesn't find a matching key in the dictionary, it will take the next available bit and so on.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2.2.2 Proof of Correctness\n",
    "\n",
    "It is trivial to show, that the algorithm finishes, since it traverses the encoded string from left to right and finishes once it has traversed the whole string. We have to prove, that the decoding actually results in the right text. This can be shown using the properties of the prefix code. \n",
    "## PROOF\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2.2.3 Complexity\n",
    "\n",
    "The complexity of the decoding algorithm is linear in the number of bits in the encoded string $n$. The algorithm has to visit each bit in the string exactly once and then check whether it is in the dictionary. Finding a key in the dictionary has complexity $O(1)$ in Python. So the total complexity is $O(n)$. \n",
